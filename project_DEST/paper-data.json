  "abstract": "DETR-based methods, which use multi-layer transformer decoders to refine object queries iteratively, have shown promising performance in 3D indoor object detection. However, the scene point features in the transformer decoder remain fixed, leading to minimal contributions from later decoder layers, thereby limiting performance improvement. Recently, State Space Models (SSM) have shown efficient context modeling ability with linear complexity through iterative interactions between system states and inputs. Inspired by SSMs, we propose a new 3D object DEtection paradigm with an interactive STate space model (DEST). In the interactive SSM, we design a novel state-dependent SSM parameterization method that enables system states to effectively serve as queries in 3D indoor detection tasks. In addition, we introduce four key designs tailored to the characteristics of point cloud and SSM: The serialization and bidirectional scanning strategies enable bidirectional feature interaction among scene points within the SSM. The inter-state attention mechanism models the relationships between state points, while the gated feed-forward network enhances inter-channel correlations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method to model queries as system states and scene points as system inputs, which can simultaneously update scene point features and query features with linear complexity. Extensive experiments on two challenging datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our DEST-based method. Our method improves the GroupFree baseline in terms of AP‚ÇÖ‚ÇÄ on ScanNet V2 (+5.3) and SUN RGB-D (+3.2) datasets. Based on the VDETR baseline, Our method sets a new SOTA on the ScanNetV2 and SUN RGB-D datasets.",

      "content": "Based on the query refinement module, DETR-based methods have achieved the best performance in indoor object detection tasks. However, DETR-based methods still face a key issue that limits their performance. These methods employ multi-layer transformer decoders to iteratively refine the object queries. While the transformer decoder layers update the query point features, they do not simultaneously update the scene point features as shown in the Figure (a). As a result, each decoder layer uses the same scene point features to refine the queries, leading to only marginal improvements from the later layers. As shown in Figure (b), we evaluate the detection accuracy improvements of different decoder layers in two DETR-based models on the ScanNet V2 dataset. GroupFree achieves only a 2.12 performance improvement in the last six layers, while VDETR shows a mere 0.64 improvement in the last four layers. Based on the above analysis, the fixed scene point features constrain the potential performance enhancement of the models.",

Finally, the updated state points are fed into a detection head to predict the 3D bounding boxes."

Specifically, we modify the SSM parameters (‚àÜ, B, C) to be dependent on the system states and design a spatial correlation module to model the relationship between state points and scene points. Therefore, the system states in the ISSM can effectively fulfill the role of queries in complex 3D indoor detection tasks.",

The proposed serialization strategy is designed to serialize the scene points based on the Hilbert curve, benefiting from its locality-preserving properties. The IBS module is designed to achieve bidirectional interaction among different scene points, while the inter-state attention module is designed to capture the relationships between state points. Lastly, the GFFN is designed to enhance inter-channel correlations through a gated linear unit.
